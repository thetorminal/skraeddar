## "Making of"
**The build**  
I am honest - this is build with a lot of support from https://claude.ai. The basic structure was generated, the code was edited from me until i liked it - so not completely "vibe-coded".  
If you dont trust the website [skraeddar.torminal.com](https://skraeddar.torminal.com) or want an offline version, just host it yourself with npm (use the installation instructions in this ReadMe).  
**The name**  
The name "Skr√§ddar" comes from the swedish word skr√§ddarsydd, which means "tailored" - i thought, this is a fitting title for a project like this!  
**The inspiration**  
Also visit https://skapa.build/ - Skr√§ddar is strongly inspired from it (it doesnt look as nice as skapa, but anyways..) and allows you to create customized boxes you can integrate on SKADIS.
